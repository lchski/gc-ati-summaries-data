# Full historical data is stored in the root of the repository, `ati-full-historical-data.csv`

# Data we've been maintaining is also stored in the root, `ati-summaries.csv`

# Then, we'll likely need to check for and eliminate duplicates. We can (hopefully!) do
# this with the existing duplicate handlers we have.
